## Installation

### Requirements
- Linux or macOS with Python ≥ 3.8
- PyTorch ≥ 1.13 is recommended and [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/) that matches the PyTorch installation.
  Install them together at [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org) to make sure of this. Note, please check
  PyTorch version matches that is required by Detectron2.
- Detectron2: follow [Detectron2 installation instructions](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/install.html).
- OpenCV is optional but needed by demo and visualization
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

An example of installation is shown below:

```
git clone https://github.com/tmhoanggg/HyRo.git
cd HyRo
conda create -n hyro python=3.12
conda activate hyro
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Overview

**HyperCLIP** is a lightweight and effective fine-tuning framework built upon CLIP for **open-vocabulary semantic segmentation**. Motivated by the observation that segmentation requires alignment at **pixel-level hierarchical granularity**, this work explores fine-tuning CLIP in **hyperbolic space**, which shifts the hierarchical granularity of CLIP's embedding from image-level to pixel-level, thereby equipping it with segmentation capability.

### Key Findings
- **Hyperbolic radius alignment via fine-tuning:** The hyperbolic radius of CLIP's text embeddings **decreases**, showing that the text encoder shifts from image-to-text to pixel-to-text alignment.
- **Hyperbolic radius adjustment:** HyperCLIP explicitly introduces **hyperbolic radius adjustment** for CLIP's embeddings to better align vision and language representations in hyperbolic space.
- **Parameter efficiency:** Only **~4%** of CLIP’s parameters are fine-tuned, yet HyperCLIP attains **state-of-the-art performance** across **three open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks**.
- **Characteristic hyperbolic level:** After fine-tuning, text embeddings converge to a **stable hyperbolic radius** across different datasets, suggesting that segmentation tasks correspond to a **characteristic hierarchy level** in hyperbolic geometry.


## 📊 Visualizing Hyperbolic Radius Alignment

The figure below illustrates how CLIP embeddings evolve during HyperCLIP fine-tuning:

- Image-level semantics (large radius) → pixel-level semantics (smaller radius).
